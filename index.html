            <p style = "margin-top: 4px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;line-height: 23px;"><dfn>Large Language Models</dfn> are a type of narrow AI specifically designed to understand and generate human language. They are trained on massive datasets of text and can perform a range of language-related tasks like answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages, and more. <br>
            <br>
            LLMs can generate human-like text, answer questions, provide explanations, and engage in conversations. They rely on patterns learned from training data and do not possess true understanding or reasoning. They lack general-world knowledge beyond their training and cannot autonomously adapt to new types of tasks without additional training or fine-tuning.<br>
            <br>
            Their focus is specifically on language—understanding and generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.</p>

        <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 4px;">Key Products of LLMs</h3>
        <p style = "margin-top: 0px;line-height: 23px;">There are multiple products of LLMs available in the market for free, along with paid subscriptions for advanced capabilities such as advanced reasoning, data analysis, image generation based on text input, image analysis etc. Among the many following are the famous ones:</p>
        <ul style="line-height: 23px;">
            <li>ChatGPT (by OpenAI)</li>
            <li>Google Gemini</li>
            <li>Copilot (by Microsoft)</li>
            <li>LLaMA (by Meta)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here is a brief description and the comparative analysis of each one of the above models</p>

            </figure>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;margin-left: 15px;line-height: 30px;">ChatGPT is considered to be the most matured model and having advanced capabilities than the rest of the LLMs and was developed by OpenAi and the major version was released to public on 30th Nov, 2022. There are multiple versions of models released into the market over a period of time, with improvements for each release.<br>
            GPT-1 was released in the year 2018 and it was not a public release and GPT-2 in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020 which was a major breakthrough featuring 175 billion parameters.<br><br>
            ChatGPT was built on top of GPT-3.5, which came into limelight and gained huge public attention.<br><br>
            GPT-4, released in March 2023, is the latest iteration used in the ChatGPT product, providing enhanced reasoning, more coherent responses, and the ability to understand and generate multimodal inputs (i.e., text and images). It is available through the ChatGPT Plus subscription, offering a significant upgrade in capabilities compared to GPT-3.5.ChatGPT has 200 million weekly active users worldwide.ChatGPT accounts for 69.9% of the market share of the AI tools.<br> <a href = "https://chatgpt.com" target = "_blank">Access ChatGPT</a></p>

        </figure>
        <p>Gemini, the AI language model, was initially released on December 6, 2023. It was announced as a competitor to OpenAI's GPT-4. </p>
        <h4 style = "font-size: large;">Key Features of Gemini</h4>
        <p>
            <strong>Multimodal capabilities:</strong> Gemini can process and generate text, code, images, and audio, making it more versatile than many other LLMs.<br><br>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong> It's designed to be efficient, allowing it to perform tasks quickly and accurately.<br><br>
            <strong>Safety:</strong> Google has implemented safety measures to minimize harmful outputs and biases.<br><br>
            <strong>Customization:</strong> Gemini can be tailored to specific needs and applications.<br>

        <h3>Copilot (by Microsoft)</h3>
        <figure style="float: left; width: 15%;">

        </figure>
        <p>Developed by Microsoft and launched on 7th Feb, 2023<br><br>
        There are multiple versions of Copilot available in the market with each version having specific use cases. For Example 'GitHub Copilot' for developers. GitHub Copilot is like a supercharged coding buddy. It helps programmers by suggesting code snippets and whole lines as they type, based on the context of what they're working on. It’s like having an extra pair of hands and a second brain while you’re coding.<br><br>
        GitHub Copilot is the main one designed to assist developers directly within their code editor. But "Copilot" as a concept is expanding beyond coding. Microsoft has started to integrate similar AI assistance in different software, like Microsoft 365 Copilot for tasks in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.<br>
